        "**Q1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
        "**A1:** Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line, while compiled languages convert code into machine language before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2: What is exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "**A2:** Exception handling manages runtime errors, ensuring the program continues execution or handles failures gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "**A3:** The `finally` block executes code regardless of exceptions, often used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4: What is logging in Python?**  \n",
        "**A4:** Logging tracks events during program execution for debugging or monitoring.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q6: What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**  \n",
        "**A6:** `import` imports the entire module; `from ... import` imports specific attributes.\n",
